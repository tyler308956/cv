        <p><em>Customer Service Operations Leader and Data Scientist</em></p>
        <p>I am a self-taught polyglot and developer who guides those who want to learn another language. I love the "Soulsborne" video game series and also brew my own beer</p>
        <p>I believe that people are often capable of far greater successes than they <br>
          think achievable, it is just a question of nurturing them – and in this way <br>
          I give as good as I get. I thrive when I am able to support others as I am <br>
          supported and am able to create the conditions for dynamic co-working and <br>
          structures of development for my peers to achieve their aims and produce results.

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <p>I have a life-long desire to understand and connect with the people I encounter. At the University of North Texas, I took Programming and Communications courses specifically to address
    how to make those connections more effective. Foreign Languages and Computer Science gave me a lens with which to scrutinize and interpret both the world around me
    and many of the challenges I have confronted in my career, particularly in how it gave me an appreciation for scrupulous order and detailed structure. I obtained
    a Bachelor's Degree in Spanish and a Minor in Computer Science. I have also obtained the following certfications:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://coursera.org/verify/professional-cert/GE83MB77PCEJ" target="_blank">Google Data Analytics</a></li>
    <li>Responsive Web Design</li>
  </ul>
